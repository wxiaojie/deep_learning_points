GAP does through taking an average of every incoming feature map. 
So it allows you to have the input image be any size, not just a fixed size like 224x224.

For example, with a 15x15x8 incoming tensor of feature maps, we take the average of each 15x15 matrix slice, 
giving us an 8 dimensional vector. We can now feed this into the fully connected layers.

Notice how that the size of the matrix slices can change, for example, the input might be 32x32x8, 
and weâ€™ll still get an 8 dimensional vector as an output from the global average pooling layer.

As described in paper Network In Network, GAP is easier to interpret and less prone to overfitting than traditional fully connected layers.
